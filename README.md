# HelpLindsay
Collection of scripts to help me with various tasks.

Mostly automation, time-savers (that took time to write!); mostly documented

Tasks include things like:

* renaming files
* creating HTML files from CSV data
* inviting people (from Excel file) to Slack channels
* finding students (from Excel file) with subject clashes
* deleting all messages in Slack channels (listed in file)
